# Tech Stack

For this project I will be using the MERN stack that we have been learning in school.

# Proposal

The project that I will be working on during this course is called LFG.  This stands for Looking For Group.  This project will be a social media site that focuses on gamers.  I would like this site to have full CRUD functionality.  I am looking at various dating apps for the matching functionality.  For this site it will be used for finding friends with similar gaming interests.  I will be connecting the site to a random user API.
